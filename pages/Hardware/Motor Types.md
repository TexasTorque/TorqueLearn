# Motor Types

From the brand new Falcon 500s, the slightly older NEO, the compact NEO 500, and the older 775pro and CIM,   
there are a variety of motor options available to teams. This article seeks provide information about the  
 motors of FRC.

### Brushed versus Brushless Motors:

There are two general categories for DC motors, in any field. Brushed motors have brushes, and brushless  
motors do not. However, what does this actually mean? The basic principle of a motor is maintaining  
attraction between a stator (a set of stationary magnets) and a rotor (a rotating set of magnets), resulting  
in circular motion. 

A brushed motor's stator is made up of two opposite poles facing in towards the rotor, attracting the rotor,  
composed of copper coil electromagnets. However, if the charges of the rotor electromagnets remain constant,  
the rotor would move into orientation with the stator and then stop, which does not produce the desired  
continuous rotation. Instead the polarity of the electro magnets must be reversed every 180 degrees (in  
the simplest of motors) so that attraction is maintained between the rotor and stator. Here's the complicated  
part. Attached to the back of the rotor (and spinning with it) is the commutator. This is a cylinder of copper  
with period interruptions (ever 180 degrees as before). On either side of the commutator, fixed to the  
non-rotating stator are two sets of carbon brushes, where electricity flows in one side and out the other.  
The electricity flows from the commutator into the rotor electromagnets, setting their polarity. When the  
motor rotates further, the brushes disconnect from the commutator wheel, which introduces a small period  
of free spin until the brushes contact the other side, reversing the polarity of the electromagnets on the  
rotor, and starting the cycle again.

On a brushless motor, the magnets on the rotor are permanent. Sourrounding the rotor on the stator, there  
is an array of coil electromagnets. Instead of the electro-mechanical method of switching electromagnet  
polarity in the brushed motor, a brushless motor utilizes integrated circuits that progressively switch
the stator magnets on and off, dragging the rotor with it.

It's okay to say that brushless motors are better in most cases (when designed well). They don't rely  
on fragile brushes constantly making contact with the rotor, produce less heat, and can more easilyintegrate encoding (due to the fact that the rotations are controlled by a computer in the first place)
