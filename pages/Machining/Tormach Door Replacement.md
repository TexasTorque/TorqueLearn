# Tormach Door Replacment

## Removing Doors
Before replacing the plastic portions of the doors it is nesecary to remove the complete door asembly. On the two sets of front doors this is done by removing the two 9/16 nuts holding each of the four doors to the I-bolt on the upper rail. For the side doors the handle must be removed with a philips head screw driver from the inside of the door. After the handle is removed the doors can be slid out of the top of the machine. The plastic portions of the front doors can be removed using an 11mm socket and a philips head screw driver.

## Chosing and Cutting material
1/8 inch polycarbonate should be used to replace the doors, as acrylic will crack. The old doors should be used as a template on the table saw to cut new doors at the same size.

## Ataching new plastic portion
When ataching the platic portion of the door allign the polcarbonate peice with the frame of the door. Use a 5/16in drill bit to drill holes in the polycarbonate usign the frame to align. Holes for the handle on the side doors also need 3/16in drill bit, as well as the handles on the front door.

## Reattching Doors
To rettach the doors first align the I-bolts to the holes in the frame, then tighten the 9/16 nuts. The doors may need adjustment in either height or level to ride smothly and mate correctly. This can be done by raising or lowering the top nut then loosening or tightening the bottom nut as neccecaary, until the correct height or level is achived. The side doors will need to lifted to the top of the machine to be reinserted. It may be nesecary to have a secound person help to align the doors with the interior tracks.
