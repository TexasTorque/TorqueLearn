# Jack's Plan for Success

During a competition, programmers are usually only given a couple days with the robot to get it fully operational. As such, it is imperative to create a streamlined development procedure.

### Roles

Each programmer requires a *role*. Roles dictate what their duties. Below is a list of the usual roles:

* **Lead** - The Lead orchestrates development of the entire robot.
* **Assistant Lead** - The Assistant Lead assists the Lead in managing the programmers.
* **Programmer** - A Programmer is a general role that is further divided into sub-roles:
    * *Ports and Constants* - Responsible for determining the robot's ports and constants.
    * *Input* - Responsible for setting up the Input.java file.
    * *Robot.java* - Responsible for setting up the Robot.java file.
    * *Feedback* - Responsible for setting up the Feedback.java file.
    * *~Subsystem~* - Responsible for setting up the specified subsystem.
* **Rookie** - A Rookie is a general role for new additions to the programming team which may lack enough knowledge to beneficially contribute during the short time frame. They can shadow the programming section.

### Boilerplate

Each programmer should implement _boilerplate_ code first, instead of aiming for functionality first. This includes creating all instance variables and getters/setters before writing main logic as this enables other programmers to interface with your part instantly.

### Asking for help

Do that. :)
